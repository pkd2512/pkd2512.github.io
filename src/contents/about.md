## A storyteller, passionate about data&nbsp;visualisation

At <LinkButton target=_blank label='Reuters' url='https://www.reuters.com/authors/prasanta-kumar-dutta/' />, I work mainly with the EMEA desk covering breaking news as well as graphics driven stories. My work typically involves a combination of research and data analysis, data gathering, ideating visuals, making maps and charts, and putting them all together on a responsive webpage.

I combine my knowledge of designing interfaces with my love for coding (HTML/CSS/JS).  I have extensively used D3 to develop interactive dataviz along with other libraries for canvas-based graphics. For data analysis, I mainly rely on Excel, Observable notebooks and a pinch of Python when required. I also
enjoy working with spatial datasets and a big part of my work needs me to make maps from raw datasets using tools like QGIS. For design, I mainly use Adobe Illustrator and Figma, along with other photo and video tools in the suite.


## An engineer turned information designer 

I began my journey as most Indians do -- by pursuing an undergrad in engineering. I graduated from <LinkButton target=_blank label='National Institute of Technology Durgapur, India' url='https://nitdgp.ac.in/' /> with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics & Communication Engineering in 2015. During that time, I developed an interest in <LinkButton target=_blank label='robotics' url='https://www.slideshare.net/secret/FYLgD09ElKVZ7F' />, <LinkButton target=_blank label='movie-making' url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEBk9fZOdEY' /> and of course <LinkButton target=_blank label='graphic design' url='https://www.behance.net/gallery/22482999/MOTOR-Zundung-5' />. A year later, I decided to pursue a formal education in design which led to pursue a Masters in Information Design from <LinkButton target=_blank label='National Institute of Design Bangalore, India' url='https://www.nid.edu/academics/programmes/master-of-design-mdes/information-design-mdes' />.

In the meanwhile, I briefly worked as --

- An Assistant Manager at an e-learning startup, where I managed the creation and curation of high school maths and science content among other things. 

- A Graphic Designer at a digital marketing agency, where I designed ads, infographics and other <LinkButton target=_blank label='promotional materials' url='https://www.facebook.com/eklakshyatransformations/videos/1623378141305834' />.

- A freelance UX-UI designer for a digital commerce app, where I ideated user journeys and designed app screens and other <LinkButton target=_blank label='UI assets' url='https://www.behance.net/gallery/52114777/Icon-Design-for-local-shopping-app-Bottleview' />.
