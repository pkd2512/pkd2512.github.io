intro:
  hed: Winter air pollution in north India

  dek: "Each year, from late October, a thick blanket of smog settles over vast swathes of northern India, including the capital, New Delhi, pushing air pollution levels off the charts. 

  <br>
  I worked on this three-part series as a part of my Master's graduation project that looks at the causes, severity and extent of the systemic problem using data collected from air quality monitors, satellite imagery from NASA and photographic evidence."

## Creative brief

Delhi‚Äôs deteriorating air quality in the cold season was not a new phenomenon and had already been widely reported on. However, we wanted to investigate the nuances through the lens of data and explore storytelling ideas for explaining them to the mass audience, as a means of creating awareness before the upcoming cold season by developing interactive visuals for the same.

## Research and analysis

We were familiar with the most common causes that the increased air pollution were attributed to -- crop stubble burning in the neighbouring states and burning of firecrackers during the festival of Diwali. After a brief reading on how to best quantify air quality, we sourced some data for particulate pollutants in the city and plotted along with the stubble burning data.

  After extensive secondary research, we were able to narrow down major elements of the system that contribute to the air quality in the region.
