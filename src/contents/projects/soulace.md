intro:
  hed: Soulace

  dek: "Coping with the death of a loved one is not an easy task. There is a need for a service for such situations that can make the experience of dealing with hospitals, funeral homes, offices and their convoluted formalities a less unpleasant one. 

  <br>
  I worked on conceptualising and designing this service experience during my Masters."
