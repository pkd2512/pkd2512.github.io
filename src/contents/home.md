## At the intersection of information design, web development and data journalism

I design data-driven visual narratives that help transform information to knowledge using charts, maps and interactive data visualisations. Several of my work over the years have been recognised with various awards including the SND awards. <LinkButton label='Read&nbsp;more' url='about/' />

## Towards dataviz literacy 

I love to talk about design and data visualisation.
Over the years, I have instructed design students on data representation, geovisualisation and data storytelling at eminent institutes across India like the National Institute of Design and JK Lakshmipat University. <LinkButton label='See all talks and workshops' url='talks/' />
