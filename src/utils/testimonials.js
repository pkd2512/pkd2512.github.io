      "Prasanta was my mentor before and during the preparation for NID DAT/CEED preparations in 2018. I had no proper design background and clearly nothing on Interaction Design in terms of knowledge or professional experience. He was always ready to listen and provide me with personalized recommendations. He was my source to all the knowledge and grooming that was needed to dive into the world of Design. I couldn't be happier or grateful with the kind of mentorship cum friendship I recieved from Prasanta.",
