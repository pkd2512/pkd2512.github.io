                <p class="lead text-font">Known as the "Tea capital of North lndia", Palampur is a town lying in the laps of the Kangra valley, surrounded by tea gardens and pine forests which gradually merge with the Dhauladhar ranges. Located at an elevation of 1,472 m above sea-level at the confuence of the Himalayas and plains, it enjoys the best of both but the horrors of neither, which makes it a huge attraction for tourists from lndia and abroad alike. The town has derived its name from the local word <em>'palum'</em>, meaning lots of water, which is attributed to the numerous steams flowing across the valley. Besides being a treasure trove of scenic beauty, it has also been a hotbed of art and culture for a very long time, which provides something for people of all tastes. lt also has a large number of iconic temples and buildings constructed during the colonial period.

                    <p class="mb-0 lead subtext-font">Being one of the oldest crafts, more than 10,000 years old, man has expressed his feelings and his aesthetics in clay, in toys, in primitive deities, and in various vessels for storage of water and grain. When he came to know the beauty of a pot thrown on a wheel and its decoration, pottery took on a new meaning for him. History came to be depicted on it.</p>

                <p class="lead text-font wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s">The concept of pottery as an art form was introduced to India in 1952 by Sardar Gurcharan Singh, fondly known as <em>'Daddyji'</em>' with the establishment of "Delhi Blue Pottery". Slipware is pottery identified by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing. Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica.<br></p>
                <p class="lead text-font wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s">As the wave of urbanisation swept over Delhi, with the repercussions of political unrest, the pottery was shifted to Andretta, a village 13 km from Palampur, in 1984. The responsibility had passed on to Daddyji's son, Mansimran <em>'Mini'</em> Singh, and his wife Mary Singh.<br>Today, the place not only is the hub of slipware pottery, but also serves as a training centre for people interested in learning the craft of studio pottery.</p><br>

                <h1 class="h1-responsive display-font py-3">The Idea</h1>
                <p class="lead text-font">We, a team of four people &mdash;<a href="https://www.behance.net/jasleenrana" target="_blank"> Jasleen Rana</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/faaizasaeed" target="_blank"> Faaiza Saeed</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/niranjanmorkar" target="_blank"> Niranjan Morkar</a> and I, had decided to study the life and rich culture of Palampur and document the studio pottery in Andretta. The idea was to bring out the essence of the place to the rest of the world through an academic project, while identify problem areas that can be intervened in.<br>The research study, spanning a little over a week, turned into a fun trip that involved studying pottery, interviewing people, clicking pictures, making new friends and romancing with Nature.

Only ourselves. Do not be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered."</p>

                        <p class="lead text-font wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Holmes and Watson head to The Daily Telegraph and place an ad to draw out the criminal. It reads: "To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake. Pierrot." The trap works and Holmes catches the criminal: Colonel Valentine Walter, the brother of Woolwich Arsenal's chief. He confesses to working for Hugo Oberstein to obtain the submarine plans in order to pay off his debts.</p>
