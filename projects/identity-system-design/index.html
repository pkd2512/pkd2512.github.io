                <p class="lead text-font">We live in a society that is transactional by nature. Our very means of survival lies on how we exchange information and services in our daily lives.                     
                </p>

                    <figcaption class="text-font small text-center">A simple transactional system</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="lead text-font">Such transactions depend on “trust”, which when reinforced, builds credibility. However, what forms the basis of trust is “identity”.                     
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-font">In terms of the web, Trust is the mechanism that is used to decide that a key is valid. A key is valid if it is actually owned by the person who claims to own it.

                <p class="lead text-font">Let us take a scenario where Kriti shares a certificate with Prafulla.                     
                </p>                
                <p class="lead text-font"><em>Direct Trust</em><br>Prafulla trusts that the certificate is Kriti’s because Kriti gave it to him. Direct trust is the most straightforward type of trust and is most trustworthy.                      
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-font"><em>Hierarchical Trust</em><br>Prafulla considers Kriti’s certificate to be valid because the Dean signed it. Prafulla trusts the Dean to be an authority on accurate signing. Prafulla can trace a chain of certificates so on to verify the authenticity of the hierarchy. The drawback of Hierarchies is that they are brittle; because they are brittle, there is a natural tendency to limit the scope of a hierarchy. In general, passports and drivers’ licenses are not unified, for example. They cannot be used interchangeably as they originate from different hierarchies which may not have established a mutual trust.                      
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-font"><em>Cumulative Trust</em><br>Prafulla considers the certificate, signed by the Dean, valid only after Kriti shows her institute identity card. The simplest cumulative trust system is the question, “may I see two forms of ID, please?” The security assumption is that it is much harder to have two erroneous trust paths than one.                      
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-font">We are aware of the repercussions of falsification of identity. There are numerous instances of identity theft, financial frauds, medical malpractices and even governance by criminals.

                <p class="lead text-font">Identity is only a problem for other people and institutions. It is never such a problem for people of sound self-aware minds. For the likes of a government, the requirements of holding an identity are artificial in the sense that in the absence of the government, the identity is meaningless. It is something that is imposed upon an individual to distinguish between individuals. The natural presumption is that an individual is a ‘body’ and so some biometric data would seem a suitable identifier of individuals.                                         
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-font">
                    But the very presumption that an identity has an associated physical body is ever being challenged in the modern world of commerce and technology. It has long been anti-intuitive nonsense that a ‘corporation’ can have legal status as a ‘person’ when no two things could be more dissimilar.
                    <br><br>Any trust that an identity must be a person is further blown away by the internet ecology where a perceived identity may be a person or maybe a toaster.

If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, Citizen Card) or Passport Card. Some countries issue formal identity documents, as national identification cards which may be compulsory or non-compulsory, while others may require identity verification using regional identification or informal documents. When the identity document incorporates a person's photograph, it may be called photo ID.</p>

                    <li><p class="lead text-font">An unidentified population inhibits the state’s capacity for effective governance. Targeted design and delivery of government services rest on a state’s ability to identify (who are you?) and authenticate (are you who you say you are?) individuals.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="lead text-font">There should be a way to prove a person’s identity securely, in order to avoid mismatching people, and to fight fraud.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="lead text-font">Private alternatives, such as id cards issued by banks, inherently lack consistency regarding issuance policies which can lead to downstream problems. For example, in Sweden private companies such as banks (citing security reasons) refused to issue ID cards to individuals without a Swedish card. This forced the government to start issuing national cards. It is also harder to control information usage by private companies, such as when credit card issuers or social media companies map purchase behaviour in order to assist ad targeting.</p></li>

                        <li><p class="lead text-font">The majority responded negatively to how they feel about sharing their identity documents with 3rd-parties like hotels.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">Most of the people digitised their documents for safekeeping.

                        <li><p class="lead text-font">Passport enrolment happens at Passport Seva Kendra (PSK), which are specialised centres set up by the government for the process. This can assure the citizen that their application is being handled by a credible authority and not some street vendor.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">The proof documents furnished by the citizen may be fake. Since they are usually not tied to any digital database (the scenario excludes Aadhar), verification of the documents is usually pivoted on the verification officer at the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK). </p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">Before the application is approved, the citizen is interviewed to test the authenticity of the documents and the information provided. Document verification happens at multiple checkpoints to minimise human errors.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">The passport office and its database of the applicant’s personal information may be prone to attacks. Also, this is the point where one might attempt to forge a passport using their resources.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">The physical police verification serves as a final firewall that can attest the credibility of the applicant. This comes from the fact the local police would be able to vouch for a resident, besides checking for criminal records, in a more efficient way than an official sitting in another city. However, in practical situations, resorting to unfair means like taking bribes for clearing the verification ticket of the applicant threatens to defeat the purpose of the exercise.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">Passports are delivered via Registered India Post, a reliable organisation suited to the purpose.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead text-font wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s">The authenticity of a passport is primarily due to a number of security features present in the current Indian passport i.e. background printing (e.g. guilloches and micro printing), security printing (e.g. fugitive and fluorescent ink), stitching thread, gothic numbering, Heat Applied Ultra Violet (HAUV) film, dicuts, fibres, watermark, barcode, Letter Screen Image (LSI) etc. Counterfeiting of passport is not a new problem. In fact, it starts from the manufacturing of passport itself. This problem is very common in India due to various loopholes in security features, which can be overcome with security features such as LSI, barcode, double lamination, etc. A layman may not be aware about any of the security features of his/her passport. Only a trained eye can detect a fake passport.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-font wow animated fadeIn" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Biometric e-passports are the next generation of passports containing a security chip with all personal data and digital images. The chip can be read only after it is unlocked using an access code when it is skimmed through a reader. With rising global security threats and international travel risks rising, e-Passports that are much harder to duplicate or fake will help increase security assurance of all travellers and immigration authorities around the world.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-font pb-3">The UIDAI conducts Aadhaar enrolment using a tiered model of Registrars and Enrolment Agencies. It enters into agreements with Registrars, which are entities recognised by the UIDAI for the purpose of enrolling residents. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font"><em>Registrars</em> are commonly departments of the central or state government, banks, or public sector organisations. An example of a Registrar could be the Rural Development Department of a state government, or a public-sector insurance company such as the Life Insurance Corporation of India. Registrars carry out enrolment themselves, or appoint Enrolment Agencies to do so. </p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font"><em>Enrolment Agencies</em> may take two forms: third-party private entities empanelled by the UIDAI based on technical and financial capabilities, or existing offices of the Registrar. Enrolment Agencies receive payment from Registrars for successful Aadhaar generation. These agencies are required to use devices and follow technical processes delineated by the UIDAI. </p></li>
                        <li><p class="lead text-font">Enrolment Agencies set up <em>Enrolment Centres</em>, which function as touch-points for resident enrolment. The UIDAI is also meant to partner with civil society organisations and community networks to broaden the reach of these enrolment touch-points and enable enrolment of marginalised populations. </p></li>

                    <p class="lead text-font">If we look at the problems carefully, they mostly stem from improper planning and execution of the Aadhar scheme. The tame problems can be solved through proper strategic planning using insights obtained from the current system state. The critical problems need better management from UIDAI to enforce strict operational guidelines for quality control and reliability of the system. However, for the wicked problems, just a simple structural change will not suffice. It requires a paradigm shift using the understanding of basic principles of identity and trust. It may also require proper legislative measures for effective implementation.</p>               
                    <p class="lead text-font">The problems arising from loopholes in the current legislation (Aadhar Act) are an equal matter of concern in a system that deals with such critical data and can threaten individuals and the nation alike. A rethinking of the system structure may help eliminate some of them, however, appropriate legislation needs to be put in place to ascertain compliance. <br><br>Some of the loopholes are stated here for consideration.</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li><p class="lead text-font">Even though Aadhar is considered a proof of both identity and address, the POA document for Aadhar enrolment is optional. If one doesn’t have (or choose not to give) an address proof, the person can choose Introducer or Head of Family based verification and get any address updated in Aadhaar.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="lead text-font">Aadhaar is not a proof of citizenship, but can be used to either apply for a passport or obtain other identity documents that can then be used to apply for a passport. </p></li>
                            <li><p class="lead text-font">Possession of a physical Aadhaar card cannot be considered as identification in airports, trains and other places as does not include any certificate of authenticity (holograms or physical signatures or any other security information).</p></li>
                            <li><p class="lead text-font">Aadhaar numbers are probably meant to be secret to avoid misuse, but UIDAI does not stop organisations from putting Aadhaar information out in public.</p></li>
                 
                            <li><p class="lead text-font">Lack of privacy laws. The Aadhaar Act puts in place some safeguards to protect biometric and identity information, however, it says nothing about personal information. The term “personal information” (not used in the Act) can be understood in a broader sense, which includes not only identity information but also other information about a person, for instance where she travels, whom she talks to on the phone, how much she earns, what she buys, her Internet browsing history, and so on. With the linking of various services to Aadhar, and the framework that allows access to identity information to “requesting entities”, there may not be much left to prevent mining of personal information and state surveillance. </p></li>

                    <p class="lead text-font">From the system analysis, it is evident that security and privacy are the two stepping stones for the Aadhar project to be sustainable. The Aadhar data being held at the CIDR, under the single authority of UIDAI makes it a single point of failure in case of security breaches and hacks (internal or external). Also, currently the people have very low control over their data or how it is used, which raises privacy concerns. The privacy of an individual can be compromised in the current system in multiple ways such as correlation of identities across domains, identification without consent using Aadhaar data and illegal tracking of individuals.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-font">According to a famous study of the 1990 census data showed that 87% of the population in the United States reported characteristics that likely made them unique based only on gender, 5-digit ZIP code and full date of birth (day, month and year). The study further reported that 53% of the U.S. population is uniquely identified only by {gender, place, date of birth}, where “place” is basically the city, town, or municipality in which the person resides. Even at the county level, {gender, county, date of birth} uniquely identifies 18% of the U.S. population. In general, it shows that “few characteristics are needed to uniquely identify a person.” Data holders often collect person-specific data and then release derivatives of collected data on a public or semi-public basis after removing all explicit identifiers, such as name, address and phone number. Evidence is provided in this study that this practice of de-identifying data and of ad-hoc generalization are not sufficient to render data anonymous because combinations of attributes often combine uniquely to re-identify individuals.</p>

Just months after they barely escaped with their lives, the Bangladeshi government is in negotiations with the Myanmar government to send the refugees back – despite evidence that Myanmar is continuing to burn Rohingya villages, bulldozing mass graves to hide the evidence and refusing to allow UN human rights investigators to enter the area. Sending the Rohingya, and all their data, back to Myanmar places their lives in great peril.

On using the dashboard, HuffPost India found the precise latitude and longitude of homes inhabited by Muslim families, Dalit families, Hindu homes and even Zorastrian families. The dashboard uses Aadhaar numbers as a unique identifier to compile detailed information about beneficiaries of a widely-promoted government subsidy programme. "Creating public, searchable, digital profiles of minorities makes them potential targets of attack," said Kavita Srivastava, who has investigated scores of communal riots as National Secretary of the People's Union for Civil Liberties. 
                                        <br><br>"A database like this, means anyone can simply Whatsapp the locations of the homes of victims to rioters. It is very scary," Srivastava concluded.

                                                        <br> <br>The user would have the idem app on a smartphone or computer, some sort of “identity wallet” where identity data would be stored on the hard drive of the device, maybe backed up on another device or on a personal backup solution, but crucially not stored in a central repository. The identity wallet would start off empty with only a self-generated identification number (idem) derived from public key and a corresponding private key (like a password, used to create digital signatures) using a randomness algorithm that ensures that every number is unique. This is different from generating username-password using third party. The person can then use this identification number, along with identity claims, and get attestations from relevant authorities. These attestations can then be used as identity information. Since identity information like residential address can change from time to time, this system will eliminate the need to run to every organisation to update information and help in keeping the data updated and consistent across all identity relationships. 
                                                        <br> <br>In case the person loses his mobile, one would need a PIN to access the data in the app. Also, there will be ways to raise a flag to prevent fraudulent transactions from the app. 
                                                        <br> <br>In case the idem is stolen, another person cannot use it as an identity, because the actual identity lies in the attestations of the identity documents which were locally stored in the original phone.
                                                        <br> <br>In case the same user needs to log into the app from a different mobile, he would have to transfer all attested documents from his previous phone. The same account can be accessed from only a single device at a time.
                                                        <br> <br>As for the attesting agencies, they will also have their identity verified and attested by authorities that trust them. For example, banks and telecom companies can be attested by the particular Ministry of the Indian Government and can be authorised to attest identity claims of their customers.

However, in a large network of hundreds of thousands of nodes full data replication on all nodes is too redundant, and the level of replication can be decreased in favour of increasing total storage capacity.

At the checkout counter, a cashier tallies the total, but Bassam doesn’t pay with cash or a credit card. Instead he lifts his head to a black box and gazes into the mirror and camera at its center. A moment later, an image of Bassam’s eye flashes on the cashier’s screen. Bassam collects his receipt—which reads “EyePay” and “World Food Programme Building Blocks” across the top—and walks out into the noonday chaos of the Zaatari refugee camp.
                                                                    <br><br>Though Bassam may not know it, his visit to the supermarket involves one of the first uses of blockchain for humanitarian aid.

If the project succeeds, it could eventually speed the adoption of blockchain technologies at sister UN agencies and beyond. It will tackle a central problem in any humanitarian crisis: how do you get people without government identity documents or a bank account into a financial and legal system where those things are prerequisites to getting a job and living a secure life?

And the consensus is growing that a blockchain should be at its center.

                                                <p class="lead text-font">In regular scenario, it is very difficult to verify the authenticity of documents like Birth certificates, driving license and so on, because they can be easily forged. One way to verify them is to get them attested by the issuing authority or a person/institute of considerable credibility. Also, just furnishing identity documents cannot establish the identity of a person with sufficient credibility. One way to do that is by physical verification (like in the case of Passports), or if the person is vouched for by multiple credible sources (like the place he works, or the bank where he holds accounts) as it builds up cumulative trust.<br><br>Using idem, identity claims will be attested by digital certificates, possibly time-bound. A digitally signed proof is as good as an attestation because the digital signature cannot be forged. Digital signatures have two properties that make them inherently better than paper document &mdash;</p>

                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p class="lead text-font">These attestations, provided by different agencies that have already verified the documents, will help in establishing trust on the UID of the person by building “webs of trust”, without the need for verifying them again.<br><br> 
                                                            The system will automatically root out fake identities that attempts to leach away government benefits and subsidies, because an identity in this system can survive only if it has sufficient credible attestations.

                                                <p class="lead text-font">According to standard notions of digital authentication, a security principal (a user or a computer), while requesting access to a service, must provide two independent pieces of information - identity and authentication. Whereas identity provides an answer to the question “who are you?”, authentication is a challenge-response process that provides a “proof of the claim of identity”, typically using an authentication credential. <br><br>In the case of Prafulla purchasing a SIM card, the POS device cannot tell if it is a fraudulent transaction using stolen fingerprints and Aadhar number. However, using idem, the POS system would request authentication from Prafulla’s mobile app and he would respond to it using the appropriate attested identity that validates his identity claim. He doesn’t need to share any actual identity document with the service provider.</p>

                                                            In the proposed model of idem, checks would be in place as to ensure that the institution gets only that information about a person that it actually needs, as per the IDPV standards and not what it seeks. Any unauthorised requests will be automatically declined by the system. In case the requests are validated, the user still can decide whether he wants to give access to that information. Also, all information requests and permissions will be time-bound and will expire if not used within a that time window. Additionally, the user will be able view and authorize identity authentication requests from various public / private entities, view all existing linkages of national identity with public / private agencies and update (data points shared or discontinue) these linkages.

This will definitely reduce risks of data collections and breach of privacy.

This, in turn, may facilitate an improved design of social policy strategies, including targeting, and early detection and warning systems for anomalies. For example, it may be tremendously insightful to be able to correlate education levels, family incomes and nutrition across the entire population or disease spread with income and education. More generally, it may enable macro level analysis from high frequency micro level data, econometric analysis, epidemiological studies, automatic discovery of latent topics and finding both predictive and causal relationships across multiple domains of the economy.</p>

                                        <br><br>Prajapati asks, “Desiring what have you come to live here?”

                                        <br><br>As Indra and Virochana go, Prajapati thinks, “Without perceiving, they go away not knowing the self. Who ever follows such a doctrine will surely perish.”

He grows rich and powerful until Bali, his son, hacks UADAI and deletes Virochana’s Aadhaar profile. Aadhaar no longer authenticates for him and he perishes.
                                        <br><br>But Before reaching the gods, Indra realises that when the eyes grow cloudy and the fingerprints worn, this Aadhaar will lead one to perish. He comes back to Prajapati and asks, “Can you teach me about blockchain self-sovereignty instead?”
